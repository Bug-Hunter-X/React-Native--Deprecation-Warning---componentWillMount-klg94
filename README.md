This repository demonstrates a common React Native bug caused by the use of the deprecated `componentWillMount` lifecycle method. The original code uses `componentWillMount` to fetch data which is unreliable.  The solution provides an updated version using `useEffect` which is the preferred method for handling side-effects in functional components. This example shows how to correctly fetch data and update the component state in a way that's compatible with modern React Native versions.
